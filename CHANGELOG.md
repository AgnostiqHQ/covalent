## [0.198.0] - 2022-09-14

### Authors

- Scott Wyman Neagle <scott@agnostiq.ai>
- Co-authored-by: Will Cunningham <wjcunningham7@gmail.com>


### Operations

- Fix `release.yml` workflow
- Adding a step in `release.yml/docker` job to trigger the AWS executor base image build in the remote repo `covalent-aws-plugins`
- Pass all the necessary inputs for the triggered workflow as part of the HTTP POST request body
- Added MacOS 12 to test matrix


### Changed

- Skipping stalling `dask_executor` functional test
- Database is initialized in `covalent_ui/app.py` instead of in the CLI's `start` method in order to support management via `start-stop-daemon`.
- Convert `COVALENT_SVC_PORT` to `int` when parsing env var
- Skipping stalling `dask_executor` functional test

### Added

- Modified `_DEFAULT_CONSTRAINT_VALUES` to a dataclass called `DefaultMetadataValues`, it is still used as a dictionary everywhere (named `DEFAULT_METADATA_VALUES` instead) but in an object-like manner.
- Modified `_DEFAULT_CONFIG` to also be a dataclass called `DefaultConfig`, which is initialized whenever needed and used like a dictionary (named `DEFAULT_CONFIG`).
- `ConfigManager` is now thread safe since it is initialized whenever needed instead of one object being accessed by multiple processes/threads leading to corruption of the config file.
- Using `contextlib.supress` to ignore `psutil.NoSuchProcess` errors instead of `try/except` with `pass`.
- Filter workflow dispatches by status on the GUI.
- Delete all workflow dispatches present in the database from the GUI and add filter level deletion of workflow dispatches as well. 
- Theme changes as part of latest wireframe.
- Factory functions to generate configurations and default metadata at the time when required. This is because certain values like default executors are only determined when the covalent server starts.
- Respecting the configuration options like default executor, no. of workers, developer mode, etc. when restarting the server.
- Unit tests for `remote_executor.py`
- Added alembic migrations script for DB schema v12
- Environment variables added to `defaults.py` in order to support system services
- Covalent OpenRC init script added

### Removed

- Deprecated `_DEFAULT_CONSTRAINTS_DEPRECATED` removed.
- Confusing `click` argument `no-cluster` instead of flag `--no-cluster` removed; this was also partially responsible for unexpected behaviour with using `no-cluster` option when starting covalent.

### Operations

- Fixed a bug in changelog.yml caused by passing a large list of commits as a var

### Tests

- Updated tests to reflect above changes.
- Updated more tests to DB schema v12
- Improved DB mocking in dispatcher tests

### Fixed

- Removed inheritance of `call_before` metadata related to file transfers from parent electron to collected nodes.
- Executor instances at runtime no longer inadvertently modify
  transport graph nodes when modifying their attributes.
- Syntax error in `tests.yml`

### Docs

- Updated AWS Lambda plugin rtd with mention to its limitations.
- Updated RTD concepts and tutorials to reflect new UI.

### Fixed

- When a list was passed to an electron, the generated electron list
  had metadata copied from the electron. This was resulting in

### Added

- `BaseAsyncExecutor` has been added which can be inherited by new async-aware executors.

### Changed

- Since tasks were basically submitting the functions to a Dask cluster by default, they have been converted into asyncio `Tasks` instead which support a far larger number of concurrent tasks than previously used `ThreadPool`.

- `tasks_pool` will still be used to schedule tasks which use non-async executors.

- Executor's `executor` will now receive a callable instead of a serialized function. This allows deserializing the function where it is going to be executed while providing a simplified `execute` at the same time.

- `uvloop` is being used instead of the default event loop of `asyncio` for better performance.

- Tests have also been updated to reflect above changes.

### Added

- Bash lepton support reintroduced with some UX modifications to the Lepton class. Leptons which use scripting languages can be specified as either (1) a command run in the shell/console or (2) a call to a function in a library/script. Leptons which use compiled languages must specify a library and a function name.
- The keyword argument `display_name` can be used to override the name appearing in the UI. Particularly useful when the lepton is a command.
- All arguments except for language are now keyword arguments.
- Keyword arguments passed to a Bash lepton are understood to define environment variables within the shell.
- Non-keyword arguments fill in `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- Named outputs enumerate variables within the shell which will be returned to the user. These can be either `Lepton.OUTPUT` or `Lepton.INPUT_OUTPUT` types.

### Added

- New fields to the decomposed result object Database:

## [0.30.4] - 2022-03-11

### Fixed

- When executing a task on an alternate Conda environment, Covalent no longer has to be installed on that environment. Previously, a Covalent object (the execution function as a TransportableObject) was passed to the environment. Now it is deserialized to a "normal" Python function, which is passed to the alternate Conda environment.

## [0.30.3] - 2022-03-11

### Fixed

- Fixed the order of output storage in `post_process` which should have been the order in which the electron functions are called instead of being the order in which they are executed. This fixes the order in which the replacement of function calls with their output happens, which further fixes any discrepencies in the results obtained by the user.

- Fixed the `post_process` test to check the order as well.

### Removed

- Removed handling of default values of function parameters in `get_named_params` in `covalent/_shared_files/utils.py`. So, it is actually being handled by not being handled since now `named_args` and `named_kwargs` will only contain parameters that were passed during the function call and not all of them.

## [0.28.0] - 2022-03-02

### Added

- Lepton support, including for Python modules and C libraries

- Missing UI executor data after server-side renaming

## [0.27.4] - 2022-02-28

### Fixed

## [0.27.0] - 2022-02-24

### Added

- Support for positional only, positional or keyword, variable positional, keyword only, variable keyword types of parameters is now added, e.g an electron can now use variable args and variable kwargs if the number/names of parameters are unknown during definition as `def task(*args, **kwargs)` which wasn't possible before.

- `Lattice.args` added to store positional arguments passed to the lattice's workflow function.

- `get_named_params` function added in `_shared_files/utils.py` which will return a tuple containing named positional arguments and named keyword arguments. The names help in showing and storing these parameters in the transport graph.

- Tests to verify whether all kinds of input paramaters are supported by electron or a lattice.

### Changed

- No longer merging positional arguments with keyword arguments, instead they are separately stored in respective nodes in the transport graph.

- `inputs` returned from `_get_inputs` function in `covalent_dispatcher/_core/execution.py` now contains positional as well as keyword arguments which further get passed to the executor.

- Executors now support positional and keyword arguments as inputs to their executable functions.

- Result object's `_inputs` attribute now contains both `args` and `kwargs`.

- `add_node_for_nested_iterables` is renamed to `connect_node_with_others` and `add_node_to_graph` also renamed to `add_collection_node_to_graph` in `electron.py`. Some more variable renames to have appropriate self-explanatory names.

- Nodes and edges in the transport graph now have a better interface to assign attributes to them.

- Edge attribute `variable` renamed to `edge_name`.

- In `serialize` function of the transport graph, if `metadata_only` is True, then only `metadata` attribute of node and `source` and `target` attributes of edge are kept in the then return serialized `data`.

- Updated the tests wherever necessary to reflect the above changes

### Removed

- Deprecated `required_params_passed` since an error will automatically be thrown by the `build_graph` function if any of the required parameters are not passed.

- Removed duplicate attributes from nodes in the transport graph.

- Renamed `init_test.py` in `tests/covalent_dispatcher_tests/_core/` to `execution_test.py`.

### Removed

- `exclude_from_postprocess` list which contained some non executable node types removed since only executable nodes are post processed now.

## [0.24.15] - 2022-02-11

### Fixed

- If a user's configuration file does not have a needed exeutor parameter, the default parameter (defined in _shared_files/defaults.py) is used.

- `LocalDispatcher` inheriting from `BaseDispatcher` allows connection to a local dispatcher server running on the user's machine.
- Covalent only gives interface to the `LocalDispatcher`'s `dispatch` and `dispatch_sync` methods.
- Tests for both `LocalDispatcher` and `BaseDispatcher` added.

### Changed

- Switched from using `lattice.dispatch` and `lattice.dispatch_sync` to `covalent.dispatch` and `covalent.dispatch_sync`.
- Dispatcher address now is passed as a parameter (`dispatcher_addr`) to `covalent.dispatch` and `covalent.dispatch_sync` instead of a metadata field to lattice.
- Updated tests, how tos, and tutorials to use `covalent.dispatch` and `covalent.dispatch_sync`.
- All the contents of `covalent_dispatcher/_core/__init__.py` are moved to `covalent_dispatcher/_core/execution.py` for better organization. `__init__.py` only contains function imports which are needed by external modules.

- Cancel function for dispatcher server API which will allow the server to terminate the dispatch.
- How to notebook for cancelling a dispatched job.
- Test to verify whether cancellation of dispatched jobs is working as expected.
- `cancel` function is available as `covalent.cancel`.

### Changed

- In file `covalent/_shared_files/config.py` instead of using a variable to store and then return the config data, now directly returning the configuration.
- Using `fire_and_forget` to dispatch a job instead of a dictionary of Dask's `Future` objects so that we won't have to manage the lifecycle of those futures.
- The `test_run_dispatcher` test was changed to reflect that the dispatcher no longer uses a dictionary of future objects as it was not being utilized anywhere.

### Removed

- `with dask_client` context was removed as the client created in `covalent_dispatcher/_core/__init__.py` is already being used even without the context. Furthermore, it creates issues when that context is exited which is unnecessary at the first place hence not needed to be resolved.

## [0.17.5] - 2022-01-19

### Changed

- Redesign of how `redirect_stdout` and `redirect_stderr` contexts in executor now work to allow storing their respective outputs.
- Executors now also return `stdout` and `stderr` strings, along with the execution output, so that they can be stored in their result object.

## [0.17.0] - 2022-01-18

### Added

- Added an attribute `__code__` to electron and lattice which is a copy of their respective function's `__code__` attribute.

- Tests to ensure usage of positional arguments works as intended.

### Changed

- Slight rework to how any print statements in lattice are sent to null.
- Changed `test_dispatcher_functional` in `basic_dispatcher_test.py` to account for the support of `args` and removed a an unnecessary `print` statement.

  will now be deleted.

- Name of a sublattice node will also contain `(sublattice)`.

- Added `_dispatch_sync_serverless` which synchronously dispatches without a server
  and waits for a result to be returned. This is the method used to dispatch a sublattice.

- Test for sublatticing is added.

- How-to guide added for sublatticing explaining the new features.

### Changed

- Partially changed `draw` function in `lattice.py` to also draw the subgraph
  of the sublattice when drawing the main graph of the lattice. The change is
  incomplete as we intend to add this feature later.

- Instead of returning `plt`, `draw` now returns the `ax` object.

- `__call__` function in `lattice.py` now runs the lattice's function normally
  instead of dispatching it.

- `_run_task` function now checks whether current node is a sublattice and acts
  accordingly.

### Fixed

- Unnecessary lines to rename the node's name in `covalent_dispatcher/_core/__init__.py` are removed.

- `test_electron_takes_nested_iterables` test was being ignored due to a spelling mistake. Fixed and
  modified to follow the new pattern.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-12-01

### Added

- Electrons can now accept an executor object using the "backend" keyword argument. "backend" can still take a string naming the executor module.
- Electrons and lattices no longer have Slurm metadata associated with the executor, as that information should be contained in the executor object being used as an input argument.
- The "backend" keyword can still be a string specifying the executor module, but only if the executor doesn't need any metadata.
- Executor plugin classes are now directly available to covalent, eg: covalent.executor.LocalExecutor().

## [0.6.7] - 2021-12-01

### Added

- Docstrings without examples for all the functions in core covalent.
- Typehints in those functions as well.
- Used `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` to prevent cyclic imports when writing typehints.

### Changed

- `convert_to_lattice_function` renamed to `convert_to_lattice_function_call`.
- Context managers now raise a `ValueError` instead of a generic `Exception`.

## [0.5.0] - 2021-11-23

### Added

- Results manager file to get results from a file, delete a result, and redispatch a result object.
- Results can also be awaited to only return a result if it has either been completed or failed.
- Results class which is used to store the results with all the information needed to be used again along with saving the results to a file functionality.
- A result object will be a mercurial object which will be updated by the dispatcher and saved to a file throughout the dispatching and execution parts.
- Direct manipulation of the transport graph inside a result object takes place.
- Utility to convert a function definition string to a function and vice-versa.
- Status class to denote the status of a result object and of each node execution in the transport graph.
- Start and end times are now also stored for each node execution as well as for the whole dispatch.
- Logging of `stdout` and `stderr` can be done by passing in the `log_stdout`, `log_stderr` named metadata respectively while dispatching.
- In order to get the result of a certain dispatch, the `dispatch_id`, the `results_dir`, and the `wait` parameter can be passed in. If everything is default, then only the dispatch id is required, waiting will not be done, and the result directory will be in the current working directory with folder name as `results/` inside which every new dispatch will have a new folder named according to their respective dispatch ids, containing:
  - `result.pkl` - (Cloud)pickled result object.
  - `result_info.yaml` - yaml file with high level information about the result and its execution.
  - `dispatch_source.py` - python file generated, containing the original function definitions of lattice and electrons which can be used to dispatch again.

### Changed

- `logfile` named metadata is now `slurm_logfile`.
- Instead of using `jsonpickle`, `cloudpickle` is being used everywhere to maintain consistency.
- `to_json` function uses `json` instead of `jsonpickle` now in electron and lattice definitions.
- `post_processing` moved to the dispatcher, so the dispatcher will now store a finished execution result in the results folder as specified by the user with no requirement of post processing it from the client/user side.
- `run_task` function in dispatcher modified to check if a node has completed execution and return it if it has, else continue its execution. This also takes care of cases if the server has been closed mid execution, then it can be started again from the last saved state, and the user won't have to wait for the whole execution.
- Instead of passing in the transport graph and dispatch id everywhere, the result object is being passed around, except for the `asyncio` part where the dispatch id and results directory is being passed which afterwards lets the core dispatcher know where to get the result object from and operate on it.
- Getting result of parent node executions of the graph, is now being done using the result object's graph. Storing of each execution's result is also done there.
- Tests updated to reflect the changes made. They are also being run in a serverless manner.

### Removed

- `LatticeResult` class removed.
- `jsonpickle` requirement removed.
- `WorkflowExecutionResult`, `TaskExecutionResult`, and `ExecutionError` singleton classes removed.

### Fixed

- Commented out the `jwt_required()` part in `covalent-dispatcher/_service/app.py`, may be removed in later iterations.
- Dispatcher server will now return the error message in the response of getting result if it fails instead of sending every result ever as a response.
