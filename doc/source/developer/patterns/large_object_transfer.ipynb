    "# Large Object Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "5. large object transfer from one task to another (A)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note here is that, in case execution of one of your electrons creates a large object, which will be required by another electron, it is better to store that object on a service of your choice, and then return the reference to it, which will be passed on to the next electron and there the object can be downloaded and used. This is much more efficient than returning that object directly, since these electrons can be run on separate machines, the back and forth transfer of these large objects will quickly eat up your resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your use case frequently requires using such transfers, you should look at using the `FileTransfer` feature of covalent here: https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/orchestration/file_transfers_for_workflows.html"
