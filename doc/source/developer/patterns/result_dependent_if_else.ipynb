    "# Result-Dependent if/else\n",
    "\n",
    "task result dependent if/else statements inside lattices (B)\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you'd like to use some conditional logic in your workflow, say, something like method (1), it'll be better if you introduced it in the resulting electron directly instead of inside the lattice, something like method (2). The reason for that is that during the workflow dependency graph creation, the return values of the `task` functions is unknown, thus these results are of the type `Electron`. This is because the execution doesn't happen, and thus the dependency of logic on the result of the task cannot be relied upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "To branch based on the result from an electron, put the branch (if/else) logic inside another electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the output of one task is a value used to choose the execution path. In these cases, perform the if/else logic inside an electron. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a lattice is dispatched, the Covalent server executes the lattice in order to build the transport graph. The transport graph is then analyzed to parallelize electron execution on their assigned executors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the server encounters a branch decision based on the output of an electron, it cannot infer the structure on which the decision depends and is prevented from building the transport graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute branching inside an electron. Electrons execution is deferred during the graph build phase, so their output cannot be used to build the transport graph and analyze the execution for parallelization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception**: Sublattices are evaluated during lattice execution and their graph structure is \"plugged in\" to the larger transport graph. If a sublattice produces a static decision variable (does not produce it by executing an electron internally), then it is safe to branch on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast the two examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates a questionable approach: choosing the execution path in the lattice based on the output of `task_1`."
