    "- This example illustrates a typical pattern in which files are downloaded from remote storage, are processed, and the results are uploaded to the same remote storage. Other scenarios can of course be implemented with the Covalent components illustrated here (`FileTransfer`, `FileTransferStrategy`, `@electron`).\n",
