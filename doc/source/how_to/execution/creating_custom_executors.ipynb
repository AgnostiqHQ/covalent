    "Executors define the low-level directions for the computation. They can specify different capabilities, eg., different hardware, different computation strategy, different logic, or simply different goals.\n",

    "Executors are plugins; any executor-plugins which are found are imported as classes in the covalent.executor name-space.\n",
    "See the how-to on [choosing an executor to be used in an electron](choosing_executors.ipynb) for details on simply choosing an executor.\n",
