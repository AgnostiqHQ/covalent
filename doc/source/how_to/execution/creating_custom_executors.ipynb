    "## Creating a Custom Executor\n",
    "\n",
    "Executors define how abackend resource handles computations. They specify everything about the resource: the hardware and configuration, the computation strategy, logic, and even goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Executors are plugins. Any executor plugins found by the dispatcher are imported as classes in the `covalent.executor` name space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covalent already contains a number of versatile executors. (See [Choosing an Executor For a Task](choosing_executors.ipynb) for information about choosing an existing executor.) \n",
    "\n",
    "If an existing executor does not fit your needs, you can write your own, using your choice of environments, hardware, and cloud resources to execute Covalent electrons however you like. A template to write an executor can be found [here](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent-executor-template).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide the purpose of the executor. You should have a good handle on the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the purpose of the executor? \n",
    "- What types of tasks is it designed to run?\n",
    "- What capabilities does the executor require that aren't already in an existing executor?\n",
    "- What hardware or cloud resource will it run on?\n",
    "- Will it scale? How?\n"

    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example creates a `TimingExecutor` that computes the CPU time used by the function to help determine its efficiency. It then writes this result to a file along with its `dispatch_id` and `node_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide whether to make your executor asynchronous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covalent is written to be capable of running asynchronous (async) executors. In general, Covalent suggests that you write your custom executors to be async-capable as well, especially if it depends on network communication or has I/O-bound logic inside the `run()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of async executors are: \n",
    "- The default [DaskExecutor](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent/blob/develop/covalent/executor/executor_plugins/dask.py)\n",
    "- [SSHPlugin](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent-ssh-plugin)\n",
    "- [SlurmPlugin](https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent-slurm-plugin).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make your executor async-capable, do the following:\n",
    "    1. Subclass `AsyncBaseExecutor` instead of `BaseExecutor`\n",
    "    2. Define your `run()` function with:\n",
    "\n",
    "        `async def run(...)`\n",
    "    \n",
    "        instead of \n",
    "    \n",
    "        `def run(...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the Covalent `BaseExecutor` (or `AsyncBaseExecutor`) and Python `typing` libraries."
