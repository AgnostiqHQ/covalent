How to approach failed database schema migrations
############

When upgrading Covalent versions from 0.177.0 to a newer version, users may need to run database migrations. In some edge cases, migrations may fail to run as a result of having existing data that violates SQL database constraints, or for other reasons specific to the type of schema updates that may occur.

For example, the following migration causes an issue due to existing data in the database.

.. code:: bash

   $ covalent db migrate
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 9b9d58f02985 -> 9f1271ef662a, v11+ updates
    (sqlite3.IntegrityError) NOT NULL constraint failed: _alembic_tmp_lattices.electron_id

    (Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/14/gkpj)
    There was an issue running migrations.
    Please read https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/db/migration_error.html for more information.

.. warning:: Ensure that you back up your database before attempting to alter it's data as follows :code:`cp ~/.local/share/covalent/dispatcher_db.sqlite /some/safe/location/dispatcher_db.sqlite` it may be worth opening an issue in the covalent repo to get additional guidance from maintainers about the specific migration issue in question.

There may be table alterations that fail as a result of some existing data in the database violating SQL constraints. In the above example that shows the migration error, :code:`electron_id` is now intended to not have NULL values however NULL values may be present in our database.
In order to avoid the migration issue we must remove any data that violates this constraint manually in the SQLlite database which resides in :code:`~/.local/share/covalent/dispatcher_db.sqlite`.
Doing this requires advanced knowledge of Covalent. It is not recommended unless you are fully acquainted with how Covalent works, since it may cause unexpected behavior.

Lastly, if you are unable to solve the issue in this manner, you may need to delete the database and re-run the migrations as follows.

.. warning:: This will cause all of your workflow data to be deleted unless a backup of the database was created.


.. code:: bash

   $ covalent stop
    Covalent server has stopped.
   $ rm ~/.local/share/covalent/dispatcher_db.sqlite
   $ covalent db migrate
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade  -> b60c5ecdf927, init
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade b60c5ecdf927 -> 9b9d58f02985, v11
    INFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Running upgrade 9b9d58f02985 -> 9f1271ef662a, v11+ updates
    Migrations are up to date.

At this point you may start Covalent as before with :code:`covalent start`
