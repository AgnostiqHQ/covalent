    * -  Computational Challenges
      - Operational Challenges
    * - Advanced compute hardware is expensive, and access is often limited â€“ shared with other researchers, for example.
      - Proliferation of models, datasets, and hardware trials.
    * - You'd like to iterate quickly, but running large models takes time.
      - Switching between development tools, including notebooks, scripts, and submission queues.
    * - Parallel computation speeds execution, but requires careful attention to data relationships.
      - Tracking, repeating, and sharing results.

With Covalent, you:

* Assign functions to appropriate resources: Use advanced hardware (quantum computers, HPC clusters) for the heavy lifting and commodity hardware for bookkeeping.
* Test functions on local servers before shipping them to advanced hardware.
* Let Covalent's services analyze functions for data independence and automatically parallelize them.
* Run experiments from a Jupyter notebook (or whatever your preferred interactive Python environment is).
* Track workflows and examine results in a browser-based GUI.
