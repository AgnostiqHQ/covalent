ðŸ”Œ Azure Batch Executor
""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. image:: Azure_Batch.png

Covalent Azure Batch executor is an interface between Covalent and `Microsoft Azure Batch <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/batch/#overview>`_. This executor allows execution of Covalent tasks on Azure's Batch service.

The batch executor is well suited for compute/memory intensive tasks since the resource pool of compute virtual machines can be scaled accordingly. Furthermore, Azure Batch allows running tasks in parallel on multiple virtual machines and their scheduling engine manages execution of the tasks.

===============
1. Installation
===============

To use this plugin with Covalent, simply install it using :code:`pip`:

.. code:: bash

    pip install covalent-azurebatch-plugin


================
2. Usage Example
================

In this example, we train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using an instance of the Azure Batch executor. The :code:`train_svm` electron is submitted as a batch job in an existing Azure Batch Compute environment. Note that we also require :doc:`DepsPip <../../concepts/concepts>` in order to install the python package dependencies before executing the electron in the batch environment.

.. code-block:: python

    from numpy.random import permutation
    from sklearn import svm, datasets
    import covalent as ct

    from covalent.executor import AzureBatchExecutor

    deps_pip = ct.DepsPip(
        packages=["numpy==1.22.4", "scikit-learn==1.1.2"]
    )

    executor = AzureBatchExecutor(
        tenant_id="tenant-id",
        client_id="client-id",
        client_secret="client-secret",
        batch_account_url="https://covalent.eastus.batch.azure.com",
        batch_account_domain="batch.core.windows.net",
        storage_account_name="covalentbatch",
        storage_account_domain="blob.core.windows.net",
        pool_id="covalent-pool",
        retries=3,
        time_limit=300,
        cache_dir="/tmp/covalent",
        poll_freq=10
    )

    # Use executor plugin to train our SVM model
    @ct.electron(
        executor=executor,
        deps_pip=deps_pip
    )
    def train_svm(data, C, gamma):
        X, y = data
        clf = svm.SVC(C=C, gamma=gamma)
        clf.fit(X[90:], y[90:])
        return clf

    @ct.electron
    def load_data():
        iris = datasets.load_iris()
        perm = permutation(iris.target.size)
        iris.data = iris.data[perm]
        iris.target = iris.target[perm]
        return iris.data, iris.target

    @ct.electron
    def score_svm(data, clf):
        X_test, y_test = data
        return clf.score(
            X_test[:90],y_test[:90]
        )

    @ct.lattice
    def run_experiment(C=1.0, gamma=0.7):
        data = load_data()
        clf = train_svm(
            data=data,
            C=C,
            gamma=gamma
        )
        score = score_svm(
            data=data,
            clf=clf
        )
        return score

    # Dispatch the workflow.
    dispatch_id = ct.dispatch(run_experiment)(
            C=1.0,
            gamma=0.7
    )

    # Wait for our result and get result value
    result = ct.get_result(dispatch_id, wait=True).result

    print(result)

During the execution of the workflow, one can navigate to the UI to see the status of the workflow. Once completed, the above script should also output a value with the score of our model.

     - N/A
     - Container registry is required to store the containers that are used to run Batch jobs.
   * - Virtual Network
     - Yes
     - N/A
     - `Azure Virtual Network <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview>`_ is used by resources to securely communicate with each other.
