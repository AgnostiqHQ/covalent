Azure Batch Executor plugin is an interface between Covalent and [Microsoft Azure Batch](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/batch/#overview). It allows execution of Covalent tasks on Azure Batch.

Azure Batch is well suited for compute/memory intensive tasks since the resource pool of compute virtual machines can be scaled accordingly. Furthermore, Azure Batch allows to run tasks in parallel on multiple virtual machines and their scheduling engine manages execution of the tasks.
