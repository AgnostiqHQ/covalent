Slurm Executor
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This executor plugin interfaces Covalent with HPC systems managed by `Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html>`_. For workflows to be deployable, users must have SSH access to the Slurm login node, writable storage space on the remote filesystem, and permissions to submit jobs to Slurm.

Installation
============

To use this plugin with Covalent, simply install it using :code:`pip`:

.. code:: bash

    pip install covalent-slurm-plugin

On the remote system, the Python version in the environment you plan to use must match that used when dispatching the calculations. Additionally, the remote system's Python environment must have the base covalent package installed (e.g. :code:`pip install covalent`).

Usage
=====

Basics
------

The following shows an example of a Covalent `configuration <https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/config/customization.html>`_ that is modified to support Slurm:

.. code:: bash

   [executors.slurm]
   username = "user"
   address = "login.cluster.org"
   ssh_key_file = "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"
   remote_workdir = "/scratch/user"
   cache_dir = "/tmp/covalent"

   [executors.slurm.options]
   nodes = 1
   ntasks = 4
   cpus-per-task = 8
   constraint = "gpu"
   gpus = 4
   qos = "regular"

   [executors.slurm.srun_options]
   cpu_bind = "cores"
   gpus = 4
   gpu-bind = "single:1"

The first stanza describes default connection parameters for a user who can connect to the Slurm login node using, for example:

.. code:: bash

    ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa user@login.cluster.org

The second and third stanzas describe default parameters for ``#SBATCH`` directives and default parameters passed directly to ``srun``, respectively.

This example generates a script containing the following preamble:

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --nodes=1
   #SBATCH --ntasks=4
   #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
   #SBATCH --constraint=gpu
   #SBATCH --gpus=4
   #SBATCH --qos=regular

and subsequent workflow submission with:

.. code:: bash

   srun --cpu_bind=cores --gpus=4 --gpu-bind=single:1

To use the configuration settings, an electronâ€™s executor must be specified with a string argument, in this case:

.. code:: python

   import covalent as ct

   @ct.electron(executor="slurm")
   def my_task(x, y):
       return x + y

Pre- and Postrun Commands
------------------------

Alternatively, passing a ``SlurmExecutor`` instance enables custom behavior scoped to specific tasks. Here, the executor's ``prerun_commands`` and ``postrun_commands`` parameters can be used to list shell commands to be executed before and after submitting the workflow. These may include any additional ``srun`` commands apart from workflow submission. Commands can also be nested inside the submission call to ``srun`` by using the ``srun_append`` parameter.

More complex jobs can be crafted by using these optional parameters. For example, the instance below runs a job that accesses CPU and GPU resources on a single node, while profiling GPU usage via ``nsys`` and issuing complementary commands that pause/resume the central hardware counter.

.. code:: python

   executor = ct.executor.SlurmExecutor(
       remote_workdir="/scratch/user/experiment1",
       options={
           "qos": "regular",
           "time": "01:30:00",
           "nodes": 1,
           "constraint": "gpu",
       },
       prerun_commands=[
           "module load package/1.2.3",
           "srun --ntasks-per-node 1 dcgmi profile --pause"
       ],
       srun_options={
           "n": 4,
           "c": 8,
           "cpu-bind": "cores",
           "G": 4,
           "gpu-bind": "single:1"
       },
       srun_append="nsys profile --stats=true -t cuda --gpu-metrics-device=all",
       postrun_commands=[
           "srun --ntasks-per-node 1 dcgmi profile --resume",
       ]
   )

   @ct.electron(executor=executor)
   def my_custom_task(x, y):
       return x + y

Here the corresponding submit script contains the following commands:

.. code:: sh

   module load package/1.2.3
   srun --ntasks-per-node 1 dcgmi profile --pause

   srun -n 4 -c 8 --cpu-bind=cores -G 4 --gpu-bind=single:1 \
   nsys profile --stats=true -t cuda --gpu-metrics-device=all \
   python /scratch/user/experiment1/workflow_script.py

   srun --ntasks-per-node 1 dcgmi profile --resume

.. note::

Each electron that uses the Slurm executor opens a separate SSH connection to the remote system. When executing 10 or more concurrent electrons, be mindful of client and/or server-side limitations on the total number of SSH connections.
