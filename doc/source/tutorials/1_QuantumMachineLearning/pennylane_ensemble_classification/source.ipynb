    "# Using Covalent for Ensemble Classification\n",

    "In this tutorial, we show how a quantum circuit can be initialized with two different sets of pre-trained parameters and used to create an ensemble model with Covalent and Pennylane to solve machine learning classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each set of pre-trained parameters, we make independant predictions and an ensemble model is formed by choosing the prediction of the most confident set of parameters. We create a Covalent workflow that runs each initialization of the QPU device in parallel and processes the results to find the ensemble prediction. We also keep track of the individual predictions from each circuit.\n",
