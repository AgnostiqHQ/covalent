    "# Using Covalent for Ensemble Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how a quantum circuit can be initialized with two different sets of pre-trained parameters and used to create an ensemble model with Covalent and Pennylane to solve machine learning classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each set of pre-trained parameters, we make independant predictions and an ensemble model is formed by choosing the prediction of the most confident set of parameters. We create a Covalent workflow that runs each initialization of the QPU device in parallel and processes the results to find the ensemble prediction. We also keep track of the individual predictions from each circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo is based on the Pennylane tutorial [**Ensemble classification with Forest and Qiskit devices**](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/ensemble_multi_qpu.html)."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we created a Covalent workflow to predict the classes of Iris dataset using ensemble model. The ensemble model was designed to choose the most confident predictions from two set of pretrained parameters for a quantum circuit. The key takeaways from this tutorial are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Covalent helps create workflows that can take advantage of parallel execution of quantum circuits and can organize, track, and dispatch experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The ensemble model outperforms both individual parameter models.\n"
