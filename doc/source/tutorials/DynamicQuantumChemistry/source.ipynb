    "# Dynamic Quantum Chemistry Workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we discuss how _covalent_ can be used to construct and manage **dynamic** workflows that are common in quantum-chemical simulations. In this example, given a crystal structure, we seek to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relax the atomic positions and cell volume for the structure (i.e. find the local minimum energy configuration).\n",
    "2. Carve all possible surface slabs of the relaxed structure. The number of slabs is only determined at runtime.\n",
    "3. For each generated slab, relax the atomic positions of each structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be done using the materials informatics library [Pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen) and a machine learned interatomic potential called [M3GNet](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00349-3). Because the number of slabs is only known at runtime, this is a dynamic workflow and we must take advantage of the sublattice feature in Covalent to properly dispatch the workflow."
