    "# Linear and convolutional autoencoders\n",
    "\n",
    "An autoencoder is a neural network that can be used to encode and decode data. The general structure of an autoencoder is shown in the figure below. It consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a lower dimensional representation (\"code\" in the schematic below, which is often referred to as the _latent space representation_) by extracting the most salient features of the data, while the decoder reconstructs the input data from the compressed representation. Therefore, autoencoder is often used for _dimensionality reduction_. In this tutorial, our goal is to compare the performance of two types of autoencoders, a linear autoencoder and a convolutional autoencoder, on reconstructing the `Fashion-MNIST` images. With the help of Covalent, we will see how to break a complex workflow into smaller and more manageable tasks, which allows users to track the task dependencies and execution results of individual steps. Another advantage of Covalent is its ability to auto-parallelize the execution of subtasks.\n",

    "The linear and convolutional autoencoders are implemented as classes inheriting from the `nn.Module` class in PyTorch. We will define two function called `create_linear_ae` and `create_conv_ae` to create the linear and convolutional autoencoders, respectively, and add the `electron` decorator on top to make them part of the Covalent workflow. The advantage of doing this is that various parts of the autoencoder network such as the number of hidden layers and their sizes can be parameterized by the user for experimentation. For this tutorial, we will use a fixed architecture for each of them for the sake of simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a linear autoencoder, we will use four hidden layers in the encoder. Between each layer the `ReLU` activation function is applied. The decoder is essentially the \"inverse\" of the encoder, and we will use the same architecture for it except at the end an additional `Sigmoid` activation function is applied. The choice of this activation function depends on the range of the pixel intensity in the original input data. Note that the `Fashion-MNIST` dataset contains 28x28-pixel gray-scale images, so the input dimension of each image is 28x28x1. The compressed images generated by the encoder in this case would have dimension 3x3x1 in this case. In addition, \n"

    "There are a few key takeaways from the above results: 1) For both autoencoders, the training loss decreases significantly with an increasing number of epochs, indicating that the training was successful. 2) The average test loss for 1000 images is about the same as the final training loss. This means that both autoencoders have pretty good generalizability. 3) The loss of the the convolutional autoencoder is just about 1/4 that of the linear autoencoder after 50 epochs, even when the convolutional autoencoder has one fewer hidden layer than its linear counterpart. This is expected since the convolutional neural network is more complex and generally performs better with image data. However, it also took a longer time to optimize the convolutional model under the same number of epochs.\n",

    "Comparing the reconstructed images from both autoencoders against the original ones, the improvement with increasing number of epochs is pretty obvious. One can also see that the overall reconstruction quality of the linear autoencoder is inferior to that of the convolutional counterpart. This is especially evident at earlier training stages. In most cases of using the linear model the reconstructed image is only capable of capturing the overall shape of the original objects, whiling losing a significant amount of details. In comparison, the convolutional model is able to capture much more details of the original images."

    "In summary, we introduced the concept of autoencoders, constructed two types of autoencoder, linear and convolutional, to reconstruct the `Fashion-MNIST` images and compared the performance of them. We saw that using Covalent, we were able to break the problem down into a series of subtasks. Moreover, taking advantage of auto-parallelization of the Covalent workflow, we successfully conducted an experiment where we trained and tested both autoencoders at the same time. This feature gives users the flexibility in performing experiments with various models and parameters to even a much larger scale. Overall, we saw that the convolutional architecture performed better than the linear architecture for this task, and that the convolutional reconstruction was able to capture more details of the original images."
