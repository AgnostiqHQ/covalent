Tutorial Writing Guide
****************************

This guide covers best practices for Covalent tutorials. These principles are indended to guide but not constrain the author.

1. Set the scope

Good tutorials are small and self-contained. They do not overcomplicate things and cater to a mixed audience. Any examples highlighted should be straightforward and friendly to beginners.

2. Introduce the example

Introduce background material and describe what we will be trying to achieve in the tutorial. Separate the logical components and show what purpose each of them serves.

3. Prototype the solution

Write code with commented explanations wherever necessary. Write it without Covalent, in a functional manner, where it is clear what each of the components is doing in the context of the example.

4. Run the workflows

Add decorators to the functions without changing their definitions. Show representative screenshots of the UI to help readers understand the problem being solved. A good tutorial also provides typical input parameters and the corresponding typical runtimes.

5. Analyze the results

View the results in the Covalent UI, and query them programatically as well.  Summarize the findings using a meaningful plot or chart. Discuss the metadata returned in the result object.


6. Discuss the concepts

Highlight how different components of Covalent are used to accomplish objectives or to obey constraints.
