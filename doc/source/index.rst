Covalent is a Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run experiments on limited or expensive computing resources including quantum computers, HPC clusters, GPU arrays, and cloud services.

Covalent enables a researcher to run computation tasks on an advanced hardware platform â€“ such as a quantum computer or serverless HPC cluster â€“ using a single line of code.

ðŸ’­ Why Covalent?
################

Covalent overcomes computational and operational challenges inherent in AI/ML experimentation.

.. list-table::

    * -  Computational Challenges
      - Operational Challenges
    * - Advanced compute hardware is expensive, and access is often limited â€“ shared with other researchers, for example.
      - Proliferation of models, datasets, and hardware trials.
    * - You'd like to iterate quickly, but running large models takes time
      - Switching between development tools, including notebooks, scripts, and submission queues.
    * - Parallel computation speeds execution, but requires careful attention to data relationships.
      - Tracking, repeating, and sharing results.

With Covalent, you:

* Assign functions to appropriate resources: Use advanced hardware (quantum computers, HPC clusters) for the heavy lifting and commodity hardware for bookkeeping.
* Test functions on local servers before shipping them to advanced hardware.
* Let Covalent's services analyze functions for data independence and automatically parallelize them.
* Run experiments from a Jupyter notebook (or whatever your preferred interactive Python environment is).
* Track workflows and examine results in a browser-based GUI.

Recent Changes
##############

The latest release of Covalent includes two new feature sets and three major enhancements. True to its modular nature, Covalent now allows users to define custom pre- and post-hooks to electrons to facilitate various use cases from setting up remote environments (using `DepsPip`) to running custom functions. We also now support data/file transfers between remote electrons in a very modular way, including `Rsync`, `HTTP`, and `S3` protocols. As part of the enhancements, Covalent now internally uses an SQL database instead of storing results in a serialized format, which has resulted in impressive speedups and stability across the platform.  We have further made the Covalent server leaner by not requiring it to have any dependencies of electrons installed.  Covalent now only requires that your electronâ€™s software dependencies exist on the client (the machine submitting the workflows) and backend (hardware running the tasks).

Summary of major features/enhancements

- Pre- and post-hooks to setup the software environment and to run other custom functions
- Data transfer/management between electrons
- Robust database for storing and managing results
- User interface enhancements
