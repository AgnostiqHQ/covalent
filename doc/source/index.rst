Covalent is a Pythonic distributed workflow tool used to prototype and run high performance classical and quantum software. Covalent can be used to...

- rapidly iterate prototypes and exploratory research models
- construct complex workflows consisting of tasks written in a variety of languages
- automate, manage, and share reproducible experiments
- build data pipelines across distributed infrastructure
- visualize data and task dependencies in an interactive user interface
- run software in heterogeneous compute environments, including in hybrid-cloud and hybrid-quantum configurations
- understand where time and money is spent across a project

Recent Changes
##############

The latest release of Covalent includes two new feature sets and three major enhancements. True to its modular nature, Covalent now allows users to define custom pre- and post-hooks to electrons to facilitate various use cases from setting up remote environments (using `DepsPip`) to running custom functions. We also now support data/file transfers between remote electrons in a very modular way, including `Rsync`, `HTTP`, and `S3` protocols. As part of the enhancements, Covalent now internally uses an SQL database instead of storing results in a serialized format, which has resulted in impressive speedups and stability across the platform.  We have further made the Covalent server leaner by not requiring it to have any dependencies of electrons installed.  Covalent now only requires that your electronâ€™s software dependencies exist on the client (the machine submitting the workflows) and backend (hardware running the tasks).

Summary of major features/enhancements

- Pre- and post-hooks to setup the software environment and to run other custom functions
- Data transfer/management between electrons
- Robust database for storing and managing results
- User interface enhancements
