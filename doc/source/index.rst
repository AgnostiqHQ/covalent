Covalent is a Pythonic workflow tool for computational scientists, AI/ML software engineers, and anyone who needs to run experiments on limited or expensive computing resources including quantum computers, HPC clusters, GPU arrays, and cloud services.

Covalent enables a researcher to run computation tasks on an advanced hardware platform – such as a quantum computer or serverless HPC cluster – using a single line of code.

For a description of what challenges Covalent was designed to solve, see :doc:`Why Covalent? <./about/why_covalent>`. For a more in-depth discussion, see `What is Covalent? <https://www.covalent.xyz/what-is-covalent/>`_.

To learn more about Covalent in the context of modern high-performance computing, read `Covalent in the Era of Cloud-HPC <https://www.covalent.xyz/navigating-the-modern-hpc-landscape/>`_.

Recent Changes
##############

The latest release of Covalent includes two new feature sets and three major enhancements. True to its modular nature, Covalent now allows users to define custom pre- and post-hooks to electrons to facilitate various use cases from setting up remote environments (using `DepsPip`) to running custom functions. We also now support data/file transfers between remote electrons in a very modular way, including `Rsync`, `HTTP`, and `S3` protocols. As part of the enhancements, Covalent now internally uses an SQL database instead of storing results in a serialized format, which has resulted in impressive speedups and stability across the platform.  We have further made the Covalent server leaner by not requiring it to have any dependencies of electrons installed.  Covalent now only requires that your electron’s software dependencies exist on the client (the machine submitting the workflows) and backend (hardware running the tasks).

Summary of major features/enhancements

- Pre- and post-hooks to setup the software environment and to run other custom functions
- Data transfer/management between electrons
- Robust database for storing and managing results
- User interface enhancements
