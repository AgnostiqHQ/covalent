The Graph View screen shows detailed information about a single dispatch.

The page has three display areas:

:doc:`Transport Graph<graphs>`
    Shows the :ref:`Transport Graph` of the dispatch. Nodes are electrons and, if selected, task parameters.
:doc:`Lattice Sidebar<lattice>`
    Shows detailed runtime information about the lattice to the left of the Transport Graph dispatches_with_appropriate_metadata.
:doc:`Electron Sidebar<electron>`
    Shows detailed information about an electron in a popup sidebar to the right of the Transport Graph area.

.. note:: Some fields in the Graph View are :ref:`copyable as string-serialized Python objects <pickle_copy>`.
