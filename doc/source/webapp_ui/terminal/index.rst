Use the Terminal page to execute shell commands. Provided as a convenience for installing dependencies, executing scripted workflows, and so on.

.. warning:: The UI Terminal provides shell access without an SSH login. If you host Covalent on a server, consider security precautions such as restricing access from external clients.

.. note:: Stopping the Covalent server in the Terminal will kill the terminal and stop the Covalent GUI.
