========

Sort the dispatch list on any column except Dispatch ID by clicking the column heading. Click |ascending| and |descending| to toggle between ascending and descending sort.

"Ascending" and "Descending" are alphabetical for Lattice; chronological for Started and Ended; by magnitude for Runtime; and ordered (Running < Completed < Failed) for Status.

The page default is to sort by descending "Started" value; that is, most recent dispatches first.
