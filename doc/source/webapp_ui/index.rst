******************
The User Interface
******************

This User Interface Reference describes the functionality available in the Covalent GUI, organized by screen.

For help performing specific tasks using the Covalent GUI, refer to the :doc:`../how_to/index`.

The following screens are available in the Covalent GUI:

:doc:`Dashboard<dashboard/index>`
    Displays a list of workflows that have been dispatched to the server. The dispatches are summarized at the top of the screen. The Dashboard is the default screen in the Covalent GUI.

:doc:`Graph View<graph_view/index>`
    Displays details of a selected dispatch. Click a dispatch ID on the :doc:`Dashboard<dashboard/index>` to see the Graph View for that dispatch.

:doc:`Sublattice Views<sublattices/index>`
    When you open the  page for a lattice that contains sublattices, controls in the Graph View include extra options to view details of the sublattices.

:doc:`Lattice Graph Preview<preview/index>`
    View the transport graph of a lattice that you have not yet dispatched. This feature is built into the Covalent GUI as a convenience in workflow development.

:doc:`Logs<logs/index>`
    Displays the server log. Log entries do not disclose which dispatch generated them; for information about dispatches, see the :doc:`Graph View<graph_view/index>`.

:doc:`Settings<settings/index>`
    Provides controls to customize the Covalent GUI.

:doc:`Terminal<terminal/index>`
    Opens a terminal where you can type shell commands.
