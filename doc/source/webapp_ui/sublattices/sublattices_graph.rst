- For the workflows with sublattices, lattice sidebar will have a sublattices section as shown before.
- By default, the transport graph shown will be of all electrons, where sublattices dispatches are not expanded. Users can copy the dispatch id of sublattices from the transport graph.
- Users can click on any sublattice in graph to view the electron sidebar of that particular sublattice, which has details of Start time, End time, Input, Results and python function.
- Users can click on any sublattice in the lattice sidebar **Sublattices section** to view that particular sublattices' transport graph.
- When users click on any sublattice, at the top of transport graph it will show the viewing sublattice name. And there will be a revert icon |revert| beside it, which lets users go back to the main transport graph.
