Sublattices Sidebar
===================

The Sublattices sidebar has two tabs:

Overview
    Shows runtime information including start and end times, input, results, and executor type.

Sublattices
    Displays a list view of sublattices in the lattice. Click a row to display a sublattice in the Transport Graph area. The Sublattices tab is only shown if the transport graph contains one or more sublattices.
