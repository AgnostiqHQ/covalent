Sublattice Views
=========================

When the :doc:`Graph View<../graph_view/index>` screen displays a dispatch containing one or more sublattices, the screen has variations that enable you to view details of the sublattices.

The page still has three display areas, but their features vary:

:doc:`Transport Graph<sublattices_graph>`
    Shows the :ref:`Transport Graph` of the dispatch. Sublattices are shown as single nodes.
:doc:`Lattice Sidebar<sublattices_sidebar>`
    Offers a Sublattice tab in which you can select a sublattice to view its internal transport graph.
:doc:`Electron Sidebar<electron_sidebar>`
    Treats a sublattice node as an electron, showing information about the sublattice as a whole.
