- Sort allows a user to sort through a column with order of ascending |ascending|  and descending |descending|. By default, sorting is done in descending order in started column
- User can sort the lattice, runtime, started, ended and status columns
- For lattice it sorts by alphabetical order. For runtime, started and ended, it gets sorted based on time and for status, it sorts in the order of running, completed and failed for ascending order with respect to started column
