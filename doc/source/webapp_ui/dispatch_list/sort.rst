- Sort allows a user to sort through a column with order of ascending and descending. By default, sorting is done in descending order
- User can sort the columns lattice, runtime, started, ended and status
- For lattice it sorts by Alphabetical order. For runtime, started and ended, it gets sorted based on time and for status, it sorts in the order of running, completed and failed for ascending order in started column
