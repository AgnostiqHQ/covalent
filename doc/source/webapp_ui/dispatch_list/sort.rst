- Users can sort through a column by ascending |ascending| and descending |descending| orderings. By default, sorting is done in descending order of the started column.
- Users can sort by the lattice, runtime, started, ended and status columns.
- Lattices are sorted alphabetically; times are sorted chronologically; statuses are sorted by Running, Completed, and Failed states.
