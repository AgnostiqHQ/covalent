The screen has three areas:

:doc:`Transport Graph<graph>`
    Shows the :ref:`Transport Graph` of the lattice. Nodes are electrons and, if selected, task parameters.
:doc:`Lattice Sidebar<preview_lattice>`
    Shows executor information and the lattice definition.
:doc:`Electron Sidebar<preview_electron>`
    Shows executor information and the electron definition.
