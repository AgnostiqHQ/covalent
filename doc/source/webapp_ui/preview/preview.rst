- The **preview** option lets users have a view of how the graph will look for the dispatch, but it will not provide further information about the dispatch like Status, Start time, End time, Input, Results or Directory.
- To get the indepth idea of the dispatch, user can go to the dispatch list and click on the dispatch id to view the transport graph which has all the details.
