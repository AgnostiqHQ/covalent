Preview Lattice Sidebar
#######################

The Lattice sidebar is shown on the left side of the Preview Transport Graph screen.

Only the executor information and the lattice's definition are shown in the sidebar, since no dispatch information is available. (Note that the Status is reported as "Draft".)
