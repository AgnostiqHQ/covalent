Server Deployment
#################

Covalent supports both local and remote installation to suit different use cases. For quick prototyping and testing, running Covalent locally is sufficient.

For dispatching large compute-intensive workflows that require lots of CPU cores and memory, deploying Covalent as a :term:`remote` server (cloud or on-premise) uses resources more efficiently. You can develop workflows locally, then dispatch them to the remote Covalent server for execution.

Best Practices
**************

Whether you deploy on-prem or on a web service, there are some issues to be aware of that don't apply when you run Covalent locally. :doc:`This information<../developer/patterns/deployment>` will help you avoid some common remote deployment pitfalls.
