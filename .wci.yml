headline: Distributed workflows for quantum and HPC
description: |
  Covalent is a Pythonic workflow tool used to execute HPC and quantum tasks
  in heterogenous environments. Users functionalize existing code, apply
  Python decorators, and then dispatch workflows to the Covalent server. Users
  can monitor job statuses and view metadata in the Covalent user interface,
  or query information programmatically via REST API endpoints. Covalent is
  designed for rapid prototyping and pre-production R&D workflows, so that
  users can quickly identify optimal software parameters and hardware backends
  for any particular application.
