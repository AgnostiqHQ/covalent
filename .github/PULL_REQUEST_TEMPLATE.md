⚠️ Your pull request title should be short detailed and understandable for all.
⚠️ Increment the version number in the /VERSION file. If this is a bugfix, increment the patch version (the rightmost number), for example 0.18.2 becomes 0.18.3. If it's a new feature, increment the minor version (the middle number), for example 0.18.2 becomes 0.19.0.
⚠️ Add a note to /CHANGELOG.md with your version number and the date, summarizing the changes.
⚠️ If your pull request fixes an open issue, please link to the issue.
⚠️ Rebase the latest changes from the develop branch. Assuming origin points to https://github.com/AgnostiqHQ/covalent, you should run git rebase origin/develop.
