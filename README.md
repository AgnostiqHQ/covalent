## ü§î What is Covalent?

Covalent is a Pythonic workflow tool used to execute HPC and quantum tasks in heterogenous environments. Computational scientists and engineers use Covalent to...

- rapidly iterate prototypes and exploratory research models
- automate, manage, and share reproducible experiments
- visualize data and task dependencies in an interactive user interface
- run code in heterogenous compute environments, including in hybrid-cloud and hybrid-quantum configurations
- understand where time and money is spent across a project

Covalent may be deployed locally or as a set of containers. Covalent is rapidly expanding to include support for a variety of cloud interfaces, including HPC infrastructure tools developed by major cloud providers and emerging quantum APIs. It has never been easier to deploy your code on the world's most advanced computing hardware with Covalent.

Read more in the official [documentation](https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## ‚ú® Features

- **Purely Pythonic**: No need to learn any new syntax or mess around with YAML. Construct your complex workflow programmatically with native Python functions. By just adding one-line decorators to your functions, you can supercharge your experiments.
- **Native parallelization**: Covalent natively parallelizes mutually independent parts of your workflow.
- **Monitor with UI**: Covalent provides an intuitive and aesthetically beautiful browser-based user interface to monitor and manage your workflows.
- **Abstracted dataflow**: No need to worry about the details of the underlying data structures. Covalent takes care of data dependencies in the background while you concentrate on understanding the big picture.
- **Result management**: Covalent manages the results of your workflows. Whenever you need to modify parts of your workflow, from inputs to components, Covalent stores and saves the run of every experiment in a reproducible format.
- **Containerized services**: Covalent's microservices can be run as containers locally, on the cloud, on a supercomputer, or any hybrid combination of these.
- **Little-to-no overhead**: Covalent is designed to be as lightweight as possible and is optimized for the most common use cases. Covalent's overhead is less than 0.1% of the total runtime for typical high compute applications and often has a constant overhead of ~ 10-100Œºs -- and this is constantly being optimized.
- **Interactive**: Unlike other workflow tools, Covalent is interactive. You can view, modify, and re-submit workflows directly within a Jupyter notebook.

For a more in-depth description of Covalent's features and how they work, refer to the [Concepts](https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/concepts.html) page in the documentation.

## üìñ Example

Begin by starting the Covalent servers:

```console
covalent start
```

As an alternative, Covalent can be run using Docker:

```console
# Run the containers locally using docker after cloning this repository
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Navigate to the user interface at `http://localhost:8000` to monitor workflow execution progress.

In your Python code, it's as simple as adding a few decorators!  Consider the following example which uses a support vector machine (SVM) to classify types of iris flowers.

    perm = permutation(iris.target.size)
    iris.data = iris.data[perm]
    iris.target = iris.target[perm]
    return iris.data, iris.target

def train_svm(data, C, gamma):
    X, y = data

## üì¶ Installation

Covalent is developed using Python versions 3.8 and 3.9 on Linux and macOS. The easiest way to install Covalent is using the PyPI package manager:

```console
pip install cova
```

Refer to the [Getting Started](https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html) guide for more details on setting up. For a full list of supported platforms, consult the Covalent [compatibility matrix](https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/compatibility.html). Read [this guide](https://covalent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/#migration-guide-from-0-3x) if you are migrating from `cova` version `0.3x`.

## üîß How it Works

Covalent uses a containerized microservice architecture consisting of eight core services which consume and process workflows. Workflows are submitted to a queue service, which forwards them to a [NATS](https://nats.io/) message queue. A consumer service processes workflows one-by-one (or in parallel, on some systems) by forwarding them to a dispatcher service. The dispatcher analyzes task and data dependencies and submits execution requests to a runner service, which runs tasks in parallel, either locally or on a remote device, according to hardware capabilities and task requirements. Results are managed by the results and data services, and a user interface service provides an interactive dashboard where users can monitor and organize experiments.
