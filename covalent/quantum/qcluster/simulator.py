    A quantum executor that uses the specified Pennylane device to execute circuits.
    Parallelizes circuit execution on the specified `device` using either threads
    or processes.

    Keyword Args:
        device: A valid string corresponding to a Pennylane device. Simulation-based
            devices (e.g. "default.qubit" and "lightning.qubit") are recommended.
            Defaults to "default.qubit" or "default.gaussian" depending on the
            decorated QNode's device.
        parallel: The type of parallelism to use. Valid values are "thread" and
            "process". Passing any other value will result in synchronous execution.
            Defaults to "thread".
        workers: The number of threads or processes to use. Defaults to 10.
        shots: The number of shots to use for the execution device. Overrides the
            :code:`shots` value from the original device if set to :code:`None` or
            a positive :code:`int`. The shots setting from the original device is
            is used by default.
