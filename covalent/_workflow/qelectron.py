    """
    QElectron decorator to be called upon a Pennylane QNode. Adds multi-backend
    execution functionality to the original QNode.

    Args:
        qnode: The Pennylane :code:`QNode` to wrap.

    Keyword Args:
        executors: The quantum executor(s) to use for running the QNode. A single
            executor, list of executors, or a :code:`QCluster` instance are accepted.
            If a list of multiple executors is passed, a quantum cluster is
            initialized from this list automatically and :code:`selector` is used as the
            cluster's selector. Defaults to a thread-based :code:`Simulator`.
        name: An optional name for the QElectron. Defaults to the circuit function's
            name.
        description: An optional description for the QElectron. Defaults to the
            circuit function's docstring.
        selector: A callable that selects an executor, or one of the strings :code:`"cyclic"`
            or :code:`"random"`. The :code:`"cyclic"` selector (default) cycles through
            :code:`executors` and returns the next executor for each circuit. The
            :code:`"random"` selector chooses an executor from :code:`executors`
            at random for each circuit. Any user-defined selector must be callable
            with two positional arguments, a circuit and a list of executors.
            A selector must also return exactly one executor.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If any invalid executors are passed.

    Returns:
        :code:`QNodeQE`: A sub-type of :code:`QNode` that integrates QElectrons.
