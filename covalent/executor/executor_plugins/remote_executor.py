"""
This is a plugin executor module that is loaded at runtime by defining its default attributes in _EXECUTOR_PLUGIN_DEFAULTS
and optionally overriding the attributes in its constructor.

This module contains a RemoteExecutor class that provides abstract methods for implementing other remote executors.
Executor classes that inherit from the RemoteExecutor class can perform task execution by connecting with a remote environment
via SSH or Slurm or by interfacing with compute services in various cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, and GCP.
